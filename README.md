# sphinxdocs
A demonstration demo for Sphinx docs hosted on github.io

## Some resources
`nbsphinx` is a Sphinx extension that provides a source parser for *.ipynb files. Custom Sphinx directives are used to show Jupyter Notebook code cells (and of course their results) in both HTML and LaTeX output. Un-evaluated notebooks – i.e. notebooks without stored output cells – will be automatically executed during the Sphinx build process.  (https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.6/)
